    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This cheesy Buldak ramen casserole tames the heat—a little—with the addition of creamy mozzarella and American cheese. It's a quick and easy bake.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 Packages Korean ramen (such as Buldak)</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li>chilli crisps (optional)</li>
        <li>green onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>

        <li>Combine uncooked ramen, 3 seasoning packets, and 3 cups water in an 8x10-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle evenly with half the mozzarella cheese; top with American cheese slices. Cover with foil.</li>
        
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>

        <li>Remove from the oven. Using tongs, gently toss ramen until liquid and cheese are combined. </li>

        <li>Add remaining mozzarella on top; place back into the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.</li>

        <li>Garnish with green onions, chili crisp, furikake and soft boiled eggs if desired. Serve immediately.</li>

    </ol>
